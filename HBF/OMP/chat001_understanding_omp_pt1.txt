  CHUNK 1: OMP (Orthogonal Matching Pursuit) for Single-User Hybrid Beamforming

  ---
  PART A: THE EASY EXPLANATION (Building Intuition First)

  What problem are we trying to solve?

  Imagine you have a massive antenna array at a 5G base station — say 64 or 256
  antennas operating at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies (28 GHz, 60 GHz).
  In a perfect world, you would attach one RF chain (a complete radio circuit:
  DAC, mixer, amplifier, filter) to every single antenna. This is called fully 
  digital beamforming, and it gives you maximum control — you can adjust both
  the amplitude and phase of the signal at every antenna independently.

  The problem: Each RF chain at mmWave costs a lot, consumes massive power, and
  takes up physical space. With 64 antennas, you'd need 64 RF chains. That's
  impractical.

  The solution: Use only a few RF chains (say 4 or 8) and connect them to all 64
   antennas using cheap phase shifters. Phase shifters can only rotate the
  signal's phase (they can't change amplitude). This two-stage structure —
  digital processing on a few RF chains, followed by analog phase shifting to
  all antennas — is hybrid beamforming.

  So where does OMP come in?

  The big question is: how do you choose the phase shifter settings (analog 
  part) and the digital weights? You want the hybrid system to perform as close
  as possible to the fully digital system.

  Here's the beautiful insight from the landmark paper by El Ayach, Rajagopal, 
  Abu-Surra, Pi, and Heath (2014):

  1. At mmWave, signals don't bounce around much. There are only a few dominant 
  paths (clusters of scatterers) between transmitter and receiver. The channel
  is spatially sparse — it has energy in only a few angular directions.
  2. The optimal fully digital precoder (which you'd use if hardware wasn't a
  constraint) concentrates energy in those few directions. So the optimal
  precoder is sparse in the "dictionary" of all possible beam directions.
  3. Finding the best few beam directions from a large set is exactly a sparse 
  signal recovery problem — the same kind of problem that appears in compressed
  sensing!
  4. OMP (Orthogonal Matching Pursuit) is a fast, greedy algorithm from
  compressed sensing that finds sparse solutions. It picks the best beam
  direction one at a time, and at each step, it optimally adjusts all previously
   picked directions.

  In plain English: OMP is like a talent scout picking players for a team. At
  each round, it scans all available players (beam directions), picks the one
  that helps the most, then re-optimizes the entire team's strategy (digital
  weights) before picking the next player.

  Why "Orthogonal" Matching Pursuit?

  The word "orthogonal" is crucial. A simpler version called Matching Pursuit 
  (MP) would just pick a beam, subtract its contribution, and move on — never
  looking back. OMP does something smarter: after picking a new beam, it
  re-solves the entire least-squares problem over all selected beams. This
  guarantees that the remaining "residual" (what's left to approximate) is
  orthogonal to all chosen beams. This means:
  - No beam is ever picked twice (zero correlation with residual)
  - The approximation at each step is the best possible for that number of beams
  - Convergence is much faster than plain MP

  PART B: DEEP DIVE — System Model and Channel Model

  B.1 Hybrid Beamforming Architecture (Fully-Connected)

  Consider a single-user point-to-point mmWave MIMO system:

  ┌───────────────────┬────────┬────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │     Parameter     │ Symbol │              Description               │
  ├───────────────────┼────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Transmit antennas │ N_t    │ Large array (e.g., 64, 128, 256)       │
  ├───────────────────┼────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Receive antennas  │ N_r    │ Smaller array (e.g., 16, 32, 64)       │
  ├───────────────────┼────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ TX RF chains      │ N_RF^t │ Few chains (e.g., 4, 6, 8)             │
  ├───────────────────┼────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ RX RF chains      │ N_RF^r │ Few chains (e.g., 4, 6, 8)             │
  ├───────────────────┼────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Data streams      │ N_s    │ Number of spatial multiplexing streams │
  └───────────────────┴────────┴────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Fundamental constraint on RF chains:

  Nₛ ≤ N_RF^t ≤ Nₜ,      Nₛ ≤ N_RF^r ≤ Nᵣ

  In the fully-connected architecture, every RF chain connects to every antenna
  through a phase shifter. The number of phase shifters is N_t x N_RF^t at the
  transmitter.

  B.2 Signal Model

  The transmitted signal vector is:

  x = F_RF · F_BB · s

  where:
  - s ∈ ℂ^(N_s × 1) is the data symbol vector with E[ss^H] = (1/N_s)I_{N_s}
  - F_BB ∈ ℂ^(N_RF^t × N_s) is the digital baseband precoder
  - F_RF ∈ ℂ^(N_t × N_RF^t) is the analog RF precoder

  The constant modulus constraint on the analog precoder (because phase shifters
   can only change phase, not amplitude):

  |[F_RF]ᵢ,ⱼ| = 1/√Nₜ,  ∀ i, j

  Each entry can be written as:

  [F_RF]ᵢ,ⱼ = (1/√Nₜ) · e^(jφᵢⱼ)

  Total power constraint:

  ‖F_RF · F_BB‖²_F = Nₛ

  The received signal before combining:

  r = √ρ · H · F_RF · F_BB · s + n

  where:
  - ρ is the average received power (SNR scaling factor)
  - H ∈ ℂ^(N_r × N_t) is the channel matrix
  - n ~ CN(0, σ_n² I_{N_r}) is AWGN noise

  After hybrid combining at the receiver:

  y = W_BB^H · W_RF^H · (√ρ · H · F_RF · F_BB · s + n)

  where:
  - W_RF ∈ ℂ^(N_r × N_RF^r) is the analog RF combiner (constant modulus)
  - W_BB ∈ ℂ^(N_RF^r × N_s) is the digital baseband combiner

  B.3 The Clustered Saleh-Valenzuela Channel Model

  The mmWave channel is modeled using the extended Saleh-Valenzuela geometric 
  channel model, which captures the clustered sparse scattering nature of mmWave
   propagation:

  H = √(Nₜ·Nᵣ / (N_cl·N_ray)) · Σᵢ₌₁^N_cl Σₗ₌₁^N_ray αᵢₗ · aᵣ(φᵢₗʳ, θᵢₗʳ) · aₜᴴ(φᵢₗᵗ, θᵢₗᵗ)

  where:
  - N_cl = number of scattering clusters (typically 3–8 for mmWave)
  - N_ray = number of rays (sub-paths) per cluster (typically 5–10)
  - α_{iℓ} ~ CN(0, σ²_{α,i}) = complex gain of the ℓ-th ray in the i-th cluster
  - (φ^t_{iℓ}, θ^t_{iℓ}) = azimuth and elevation angles of departure (AoD)
  - (φ^r_{iℓ}, θ^r_{iℓ}) = azimuth and elevation angles of arrival (AoA)
  - a_t(·) and a_r(·) = transmit and receive array steering (response) vectors
  - The prefactor √(N_t N_r / (N_cl N_ray)) normalizes so that E[‖H‖²_F] = N_t
  N_r

  Angular distribution: Rays within a cluster have angles distributed around the
   cluster mean according to a Laplacian distribution:

  p(θ) = (1 / (√2 · σ_θ)) · exp(−√2·|θ| / σ_θ)

  with angular spread σ_θ ≈ 7.5° (typical for mmWave measurements from NYU and
  Samsung).

  Compact matrix notation:

  H = √(Nₜ·Nᵣ / (N_cl·N_ray)) · Aᵣ · diag(α) · Aₜᴴ

  where:
  - A_t = [a_t(φ¹₁, θ¹₁), ..., a_t(φ^t_{N_cl,N_ray}, θ^t_{N_cl,N_ray})] ∈ ℂ^(N_t
   × N_cl·N_ray)
  - A_r = [a_r(φ¹₁, θ¹₁), ..., a_r(φ^r_{N_cl,N_ray}, θ^r_{N_cl,N_ray})] ∈ ℂ^(N_r
   × N_cl·N_ray)
  - α = [α_{1,1}, α_{1,2}, ..., α_{N_cl,N_ray}]^T

  B.4 Array Steering Vectors

  Uniform Linear Array (ULA) with N elements and inter-element spacing d
  (typically d = λ/2):

  a_ULA(φ) = (1/√N) · [1,  e^(j·2πd/λ·sin(φ)),  e^(j·2·2πd/λ·sin(φ)),  ...,  e^(j(N−1)·2πd/λ·sin(φ))]ᵀ

  For half-wavelength spacing (d = λ/2), this simplifies to:

  a_ULA(φ) = (1/√N) · [1,  e^(jπsin(φ)),  e^(j2πsin(φ)),  ...,  e^(j(N−1)πsin(φ))]ᵀ

  Key observation: Every entry has magnitude 1/√N — steering vectors inherently 
  satisfy the constant modulus constraint! This is why they are the natural
  building blocks for the analog precoder.

  Uniform Planar Array (UPA) with W columns × H rows (N = W·H total elements):

  a_UPA(φ, θ) = a_az(φ, θ) ⊗ a_el(θ)

  where ⊗ is the Kronecker product, and:

  a_az(φ, θ) = (1/√W) · [1,  e^(jkd·sin(φ)sin(θ)),  ...,  e^(j(W−1)kd·sin(φ)sin(θ))]ᵀ

  a_el(θ) = (1/√H) · [1,  e^(jkd·cos(θ)),  ...,  e^(j(H−1)kd·cos(θ))]ᵀ

  where k = 2π/λ is the wave number.

  B.5 Spectral Efficiency

  The achievable spectral efficiency (bits/s/Hz) of the hybrid system is:

  R = log₂ det(I_Nₛ + (ρ/Nₛ) · Rₙ⁻¹ · W_BB^H · W_RF^H · H · F_RF · F_BB · F_BB^H · F_RF^H · H^H · W_RF · W_BB)

  where the effective noise covariance after combining is:

  Rₙ = σₙ² · W_BB^H · W_RF^H · W_RF · W_BB

  Upper bound (fully digital beamforming with waterfilling):

  R_opt = Σᵢ₌₁^Nₛ log₂(1 + (ρ/Nₛ) · σᵢ²)

  where σ_1 ≥ σ_2 ≥ ... ≥ σ_{N_s} are the N_s largest singular values of H.

  ---
  PART C: THE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM

  C.1 The Ideal (Intractable) Problem

  Directly maximizing R over {F_RF, F_BB, W_RF, W_BB} is intractable because:
  1. The constant modulus constraint on F_RF, W_RF defines a non-convex manifold
  2. There is bilinear coupling between the analog and digital components
  3. The joint optimization over transmitter and receiver is coupled through the
   channel

  C.2 The Surrogate Frobenius Norm Minimization

  El Ayach et al. (2014) showed that at moderate-to-high SNR, maximizing R is
  well-approximated by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the hybrid
  precoder and the optimal unconstrained precoder:

  Step 1: Compute the optimal unconstrained precoder from the SVD of the
  channel:

  H = U · Σ · V^H

  F_opt = [v₁, v₂, ..., v_Nₛ] = V(:, 1:Nₛ)

  (the first N_s right singular vectors, corresponding to the N_s largest
  singular values)

  Step 2: Solve the surrogate problem:

  min_{F_RF, F_BB}  ‖F_opt − F_RF · F_BB‖_F

  subject to   F_RF ∈ ℱ_RF,   ‖F_RF · F_BB‖²_F = Nₛ

  where 𝓕_RF is the set of matrices with constant-modulus entries.

  C.3 Recasting as a Sparse Approximation Problem

  This is the central insight of the paper. Define a dictionary matrix of
  candidate steering vectors:

  Aₜ = [aₜ(φ̃₁), aₜ(φ̃₂), ..., aₜ(φ̃_N_G)] ∈ ℂ^(Nₜ × N_G)

  where {φ̃₁, φ̃₂, ..., φ̃_{N_G}} is a fine grid of N_G quantized angles (with N_G
  >> N_RF).

  Since each column of F_RF should be a steering vector (to satisfy constant
  modulus), we can write:

  F_RF = Aₜ(:, 𝒮)

  where 𝒮 ⊂ {1, 2, ..., N_G} with |𝒮| = N_RF^t is the set of selected column
  indices.

  Substituting into the optimization:

  min_{F̃_BB}  ‖F_opt − Aₜ · F̃_BB‖_F

  subject to   ‖F̃_BB‖_{row-0} ≤ N_RF^t

  where:
  - F̃_BB ∈ ℂ^(N_G × N_s) is an auxiliary matrix
  - ‖F̃_BB‖_{row-0} counts the number of non-zero rows (row-sparsity)
  - Only N_RF^t rows of F̃_BB can be non-zero (because we select N_RF^t steering
  vectors)

  This is a simultaneous sparse approximation (joint sparsity / MMV) problem!
  The N_s columns of F_opt share the same sparse support (the same beam
  directions serve all data streams).

  PART D: OMP FUNDAMENTALS (FROM COMPRESSED SENSING)

  Before presenting the hybrid beamforming OMP, let me explain the standard OMP 
  algorithm for sparse recovery.

  D.1 The Generic Sparse Recovery Problem

  Given an underdetermined system:

  y = Φ · x + n

  where y ∈ ℂ^M, Φ ∈ ℂ^(M×N) with M << N, and x ∈ ℂ^N is K-sparse (at most K
  non-zero entries, K << N).

  Goal: recover x from y and Φ.

  The ℓ₀ minimization:

  min_x  ‖x‖₀   subject to   ‖y − Φ · x‖₂ ≤ ε

  is NP-hard. OMP provides a greedy polynomial-time approximation.

  ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

  Key property: After Step (d), the residual satisfies:

  Φ_Λᴴ · rᵏ = 0

  The residual is orthogonal to the span of all selected columns. This
  guarantees:
  - No re-selection: Previously selected atoms have zero correlation with the
  residual
  - Monotonic decrease: ‖r^k‖₂ strictly decreases at each iteration
  - Best k-term approximation: Among the selected atoms, the coefficients are
  optimal (least-squares)

  D.3 Convergence Guarantees

  Restricted Isometry Property (RIP): A matrix Φ satisfies the RIP of order K
  with constant δ_K ∈ (0,1) if for all K-sparse vectors x:

  (1 − δ_K) · ‖x‖₂² ≤ ‖Φ · x‖₂² ≤ (1 + δ_K) · ‖x‖₂²

  OMP exact recovery condition (Davenport & Wakin, 2010): OMP recovers any
  K-sparse signal if:

  δ_{K+1} < 1 / (3√K)

  Tropp & Gilbert (2007): With Gaussian random Φ of size M × N, OMP succeeds
  with high probability when:

  M = 𝒪(K ln N)

  This is information-theoretically near-optimal.

  D.5 Simple Numerical Example of Standard OMP

  Setup: M = 4 measurements, N = 6 unknowns, K = 2.

  True sparse signal:
  x_true = [0, 0, 3, 0, -2, 0]^T

  Dictionary (measurement matrix) Φ (4×6):
          col1   col2   col3   col4   col5   col6
  Φ =  [ 0.5    0.3   -0.1    0.7    0.4    0.2 ]
       [ 0.5   -0.4    0.8   -0.1    0.3   -0.5 ]
       [-0.5    0.6    0.5    0.4   -0.7    0.3 ]
       [ 0.5    0.6    0.3    0.5    0.5    0.8 ]

  Observation (noiseless):
  y = Φ · x_true = 3·φ₃ + (-2)·φ₅

    = 3[-0.1, 0.8, 0.5, 0.3]^T + (-2)[0.4, 0.3, -0.7, 0.5]^T

    = [-0.3, 2.4, 1.5, 0.9]^T + [-0.8, -0.6, 1.4, -1.0]^T

    = [-1.1, 1.8, 2.9, -0.1]^T

  ITERATION 1:

  (a) MATCH: Compute correlations h_j = ⟨r⁰, φ_j⟩ with r⁰ = y:

  h₁ = 0.5(-1.1) + 0.5(1.8) + (-0.5)(2.9) + 0.5(-0.1)
     = -0.55 + 0.90 - 1.45 - 0.05 = -1.15

  h₂ = 0.3(-1.1) + (-0.4)(1.8) + 0.6(2.9) + 0.6(-0.1)
     = -0.33 - 0.72 + 1.74 - 0.06 = 0.63

  h₃ = (-0.1)(-1.1) + 0.8(1.8) + 0.5(2.9) + 0.3(-0.1)
     = 0.11 + 1.44 + 1.45 - 0.03 = 2.97     ← LARGEST |h|

  h₄ = 0.7(-1.1) + (-0.1)(1.8) + 0.4(2.9) + 0.5(-0.1)
     = -0.77 - 0.18 + 1.16 - 0.05 = 0.16

  h₅ = 0.4(-1.1) + 0.3(1.8) + (-0.7)(2.9) + 0.5(-0.1)
     = -0.44 + 0.54 - 2.03 - 0.05 = -1.98

  h₆ = 0.2(-1.1) + (-0.5)(1.8) + 0.3(2.9) + 0.8(-0.1)
     = -0.22 - 0.90 + 0.87 - 0.08 = -0.33

  (b) IDENTIFY: max |h_j| = |h₃| = 2.97 → Select column 3

  (c) UPDATE SUPPORT: Λ¹ = {3}

  (d) LEAST SQUARES: Solve using only column 3:

  x₃ = (φ₃ᴴ · y) / (φ₃ᴴ · φ₃) = 2.97 / 0.99 = 3.0

  (e) UPDATE RESIDUAL:

  r¹ = y - φ₃ · 3.0 = [-1.1, 1.8, 2.9, -0.1]^T - [-0.3, 2.4, 1.5, 0.9]^T
     = [-0.8, -0.6, 1.4, -1.0]^T

  ---
  ITERATION 2:

  (a) MATCH: Compute correlations with r¹:

  h₁ = -1.9,  h₂ = 0.24,  h₃ = 0.0 (orthogonal!),  h₄ = -0.44
  h₅ = -1.98  ← LARGEST |h|
  h₆ = -0.24

  Notice h₃ = 0 — the residual is orthogonal to the previously selected column!
  This is the hallmark of OMP.

  (b) IDENTIFY: max |h_j| = |h₅| = 1.98 → Select column 5

  (c) UPDATE SUPPORT: Λ² = {3, 5}

  (d) LEAST SQUARES: Solve using columns 3 and 5:

  x_Λ = (Φ_Λᴴ · Φ_Λ)⁻¹ · Φ_Λᴴ · y

  This yields: x₃ = 3.0, x₅ = -2.0 (exact recovery!)

  (e) RESIDUAL: r² = y - Φ_Λ x_Λ = 0 (zero residual)

  Result: OMP recovered the exact sparse signal in K = 2 iterations:

  x̂ = [0, 0, 3, 0, −2, 0]ᵀ = x_true  ✓

  PART E: OMP FOR HYBRID BEAMFORMING (The El Ayach et al. Algorithm)

  Now we apply OMP to the hybrid beamforming sparse approximation problem. The
  key difference from standard OMP: we recover a row-sparse matrix (not a sparse
   vector), because there are N_s data streams to handle simultaneously.

  E.1 Dictionary Construction

  The transmit dictionary contains steering vectors at finely quantized angles:

  Aₜ = [aₜ(φ̃₁), aₜ(φ̃₂), ..., aₜ(φ̃_N_G)] ∈ ℂ^(Nₜ × N_G)

  For a ULA with half-wavelength spacing, the quantized angles are:

  φ̃_q = −π/2 + (q−1)π/N_G,   q = 1, 2, ..., N_G

  Dictionary size: Typically N_G = G·N_t where G is the oversampling factor (G =
   4 to 10). For N_t = 64, this means N_G = 256 to 640.

  Similarly, the receive dictionary:

  Aᵣ = [aᵣ(φ̃₁), aᵣ(φ̃₂), ..., aᵣ(φ̃_N_G)] ∈ ℂ^(Nᵣ × N_G)

  E.3 Why the Selection Criterion Uses ‖Ψ(ℓ,:)‖²₂

  In standard OMP (single vector recovery), we pick the atom with largest |⟨r,
  φ_j⟩|. Here, we have N_s residual columns (one per data stream). The atom
  selection must consider all streams jointly to enforce shared support (same
  beam directions for all streams).

  The criterion:

  k = arg max_ℓ  ‖Ψ(ℓ,:)‖₂² = arg max_ℓ  Σₛ₌₁^Nₛ |aₜ(φ̃_ℓ)ᴴ · f_res,s|²

  picks the steering vector whose total projection energy across all N_s streams
   is maximum. This is the standard approach for Simultaneous OMP (SOMP) also
  known as MMV-OMP (Multiple Measurement Vector OMP).

  E.4 The OMP-Based Hybrid Combiner Design Algorithm

  The combiner design follows a similar procedure but targets the MMSE combiner
  and uses a weighted projection to account for signal statistics:

  Step 1: Generate the Channel

  With 2 clusters × 2 rays = 4 total paths:

  ┌────────────┬───────────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
  │ Path (i,ℓ) │    α_{iℓ}     │ AoD φ^t │ AoA φ^r │

  The channel is built as:

  H = √(8×4 / (2×2)) · Σᵢ₌₁² Σₗ₌₁² αᵢₗ · aᵣ(φᵢₗʳ) · aₜᴴ(φᵢₗᵗ)

  The normalization factor is √(32/4) = √8 ≈ 2.83.

  Step 2: Compute Optimal Precoder via SVD

  Compute H = U Σ V^H, take the first N_s = 2 right singular vectors:

  F_opt = [v₁, v₂] ∈ ℂ^(8 × 2)

  Step 3: Build the Dictionary

  16 steering vectors for a ULA with 8 elements:

  aₜ(φ̃_q) = (1/√8) · [1,  e^(jπsin(φ̃_q)),  e^(j2πsin(φ̃_q)),  ...,  e^(j7πsin(φ̃_q))]ᵀ,   φ̃_q = −90° + (q−1)·180°/16

  The 16 quantized angles: -90°, -78.75°, -67.5°, ..., 0°, ..., +78.75°.

  Step 4: Run OMP (3 iterations for 3 RF chains)

  Iteration 1:
  - Compute Ψ = A_t^H F_opt (16 × 2 matrix)
  - For each row ℓ: compute ‖Ψ(ℓ,:)‖²₂ = |Ψ_{ℓ,1}|² + |Ψ_{ℓ,2}|²
  - The maximum occurs at the dictionary index closest to one of the dominant
  AoDs (likely near 30° or -45°)
  - Suppose index k₁ corresponds to angle ≈ 30° (near the first cluster's AoD)
  - Set F_RF = [a_t(30°)] (8 × 1 matrix)
  - Compute F_BB = (F_RF^H F_RF)^(-1) F_RF^H F_opt (1 × 2 matrix)
  - Update residual: F_res = normalized(F_opt - F_RF F_BB)

  Iteration 2:
  - Compute Ψ = A_t^H F_res (16 × 2)
  - The maximum now occurs near the second cluster's AoD (≈ -45°)
  - Set F_RF = [a_t(30°), a_t(-45°)] (8 × 2)
  - Recompute F_BB = (F_RF^H F_RF)^(-1) F_RF^H F_opt (2 × 2)
  - Notice: the least squares re-optimizes both columns simultaneously!
  - Update residual

  Iteration 3:
  - Compute Ψ = A_t^H F_res (16 × 2)
  - Selects a third direction (possibly near 35° or -40°, the secondary rays)
  - F_RF becomes 8 × 3, F_BB becomes 3 × 2
  - Final normalization: F_BB = √(N_s) · F_BB / ‖F_RF F_BB‖_F

  Step 5: Performance

  The spectral efficiency of the hybrid system approaches that of the fully
  digital system. For a typical scenario with N_RF = 3 ≥ 2·N_s = 4 (close to the
   2N_s rule), the gap is typically < 1 dB.

  PART G: PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

  G.1 Key Results from the Literature

  Result 1 (El Ayach et al. 2014): With N_RF^t = N_RF^r = N_s (minimum RF
  chains), OMP hybrid beamforming achieves spectral efficiency within 1–2 dB of
  the fully digital bound at moderate-to-high SNR.

  Result 2: With N_RF ≥ 2·N_s (twice the number of data streams), the
  performance gap essentially vanishes, and hybrid beamforming achieves
  near-identical performance to fully digital.

  Result 3 (Scaling behavior): As N_t increases (more antennas), the channel
  becomes increasingly sparse in the angular domain, and the OMP approximation
  becomes tighter. This is because the beamwidth narrows (∝ 1/N_t), and the
  dictionary provides finer angular resolution.

  OMP reduces the beam search from a combinatorial explosion to linear in N_RF.

  G.3 Limitations

  1. Dictionary resolution: Performance depends on how well the grid angles
  match the true AoDs. A coarser grid introduces quantization loss. Increasing
  N_G helps but increases computation.
  2. Greedy suboptimality: OMP is greedy — it doesn't guarantee the global
  optimum. In rare cases, the first beam selection can "lock in" a suboptimal
  direction.
  3. Phase quantization: Practical phase shifters have finite resolution (e.g.,
  3–4 bits). The selected steering vectors must be quantized, introducing
  additional loss.
  4. Narrowband assumption: The basic algorithm assumes a narrowband
  (flat-fading) channel. Wideband (OFDM) extensions exist but require additional
   modifications (e.g., Alkhateeb et al., 2016).

● CHUNK 2: Extended OMP for Multi-User (MU) Hybrid Beamforming

  ---
  PART A: THE EASY EXPLANATION (Building Intuition First)

  What changes when we go from one user to many users?

  In Chunk 1, we had a single user. The base station (BS) designed its analog
  beams (via OMP) and digital weights to maximize that one user's data rate.
  Life was simple — all beams served one user, no interference to worry about.

  Now imagine the BS needs to serve K users simultaneously — say 4 smartphones,
  each in a different location around the cell. This introduces a massive new
  challenge: multi-user interference (MUI). The signal intended for User 1 also
  arrives at User 2, User 3, and User 4 as interference.

  The "shared hardware" problem

  Here is the crux of the multi-user challenge:

  The analog precoder F_RF is a single piece of hardware. It is implemented with
   physical phase shifters soldered onto a circuit board. You cannot have one
  F_RF for User 1 and a different F_RF for User 2. Every user is served through
  the same set of analog beams.

  Think of it like a spotlight rig at a concert. You have, say, 4 spotlights (=
  4 RF chains) that must illuminate 4 performers on a stage. Each spotlight can
  only point in one direction at a time. You need to decide: which 4 directions
  should the spotlights point to best serve all 4 performers?

  In single-user mode, all 4 spotlights could point at one performer — maximum
  brightness. In multi-user mode, you typically point one spotlight per
  performer. But what if two performers are standing very close together?
  Pointing a spotlight at one will spill light onto the other — that's
  interference.

  The two-stage design philosophy

  Since jointly optimizing the analog and digital parts for multiple users is
  extremely hard (non-convex, coupled, high-dimensional), the community adopted
  an elegant two-stage decoupled approach:

  Stage 1 — Analog Precoder (F_RF): Use OMP (or its multi-user extension) to
  select the best beam directions from a dictionary of steering vectors. This
  stage provides coarse spatial filtering — pointing beams toward the users and
  capturing array gain.

  Stage 2 — Digital Precoder (F_BB): Once F_RF is fixed, compute the effective 
  channel (the channel as seen through the analog beams). This is a much smaller
   matrix. Then apply standard multi-user digital techniques — Zero-Forcing 
  (ZF), MMSE, or Block Diagonalization (BD) — on this small effective channel to
   cancel inter-user interference.

  The beauty: Stage 1 handles the "which directions to beam" problem. Stage 2
  handles the "how to eliminate interference between users" problem. Each stage
  does what it's best at.

  How does OMP extend to multiple users?

  There are two main approaches:

  Approach 1: Per-User OMP — Each user independently runs OMP on its own channel
   to find its preferred beam directions. The BS then aggregates all users'
  preferred beams into a single shared F_RF. Simple, distributed, low feedback
  overhead. But users may pick conflicting (overlapping) beams.

  Approach 2: Joint OMP — The BS has full channel knowledge of all users. It
  constructs a "joint target precoder" for all users combined, then runs OMP
  once on this joint target. The beam selection at each iteration considers all 
  users simultaneously, picking whichever beam helps the collective the most.
  Better performance, but requires full CSI at the BS.

  After either approach, the digital precoder is computed on the
  reduced-dimension effective channel using ZF, MMSE, or BD.

  PART B: DEEP DIVE — Multi-User System Model

  B.1 Multi-User Downlink System Model

  Consider a mmWave MU-MIMO downlink:

   Base Station (BS)                              Users
   ┌─────────────────┐
   │  N_t antennas    │          H_1           ┌──── User 1: N_r,1 antennas
   │  N_RF RF chains  │ ────────────────────── │
   │                  │          H_2           ├──── User 2: N_r,2 antennas
   │  Serves K users  │ ────────────────────── │
   │  simultaneously  │          ...           ├──── ...
   │                  │          H_K           │
   │                  │ ────────────────────── └──── User K: N_r,K antennas
   └─────────────────┘

  Parameters:
  - N_t = number of BS transmit antennas (large, e.g., 64–256)
  - N_RF = number of BS RF chains (small, e.g., 4–16)
  - K = number of users
  - N_r,k = number of receive antennas at user k
  - N_s,k = number of data streams for user k
  - Total streams: N_s = N_s,1 + N_s,2 + ... + N_s,K

  Constraint: N_s <= N_RF <= N_t

  B.2 Transmitted Signal

  The BS transmits:

  x = F_RF * F_BB * s

    = F_RF * [f_BB,1 | f_BB,2 | ... | f_BB,K] * [s_1; s_2; ...; s_K]

  where:
  - F_RF is in C^(N_t x N_RF) — the shared analog precoder (constant modulus)
  - F_BB = [f_BB,1, f_BB,2, ..., f_BB,K] is in C^(N_RF x N_s) — the composite
  digital precoder
  - f_BB,k is in C^(N_RF x N_s,k) — the digital precoder for user k
  - s_k is in C^(N_s,k x 1) — data symbols for user k

  Critical: F_RF is one matrix shared by all K users. Only F_BB has per-user
  columns.

  B.3 Received Signal at User k

  The signal received at user k (before combining):

  r_k = sqrt(rho) * H_k * F_RF * F_BB * s + n_k

  Expanding per user:

  r_k = sqrt(rho) * H_k * F_RF * f_BB,k * s_k       ← desired signal
      + sqrt(rho) * SUM(j=1..K, j!=k) H_k * F_RF * f_BB,j * s_j   ← MUI
      + n_k                                            ← noise

  This is the fundamental difference from single-user: the multi-user 
  interference (MUI) term. User k sees signals intended for all other users as
  interference.

  After user k applies its hybrid combiner W_k = W_RF,k * W_BB,k:

  y_k = W_BB,k^H * W_RF,k^H * r_k

  B.4 The SINR and Rate Expressions

  For single-stream per user (the common case where each user has one RF chain
  and receives one stream):

  The effective channel for user k after both TX and RX analog processing:

  h_eff,k = w_RF,k^H * H_k * F_RF     (a 1 x N_RF row vector)

  The SINR at user k:

                      (rho/N_s) * |h_eff,k * f_BB,k|^2
  SINR_k = ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
            (rho/N_s) * SUM(j!=k) |h_eff,k * f_BB,j|^2 + sigma_n^2

  The achievable rate for user k:

  R_k = log2(1 + SINR_k)    [bits/s/Hz]

  The sum rate across all users:

  R_sum = SUM(k=1..K) R_k = SUM(k=1..K) log2(1 + SINR_k)

  For multi-stream per user (each user has multiple RF chains):

  R_k = log2 det(I + R_n,k^(-1) * W_BB,k^H * W_RF,k^H * H_k * F_RF
                      * f_BB,k * f_BB,k^H * F_RF^H * H_k^H * W_RF,k * W_BB,k)

  where the interference-plus-noise covariance is:

  R_n,k = SUM(j!=k) W_k^H * H_k * F_RF * f_BB,j * f_BB,j^H * F_RF^H * H_k^H *
  W_k
          + sigma_n^2 * W_BB,k^H * W_RF,k^H * W_RF,k * W_BB,k

  B.5 The Optimization Problem

  The sum-rate maximization problem:

  maximize      SUM(k=1..K) R_k
    over        F_RF, {f_BB,k}, {W_RF,k}, {W_BB,k}

  subject to:   |[F_RF]_{i,j}| = 1/sqrt(N_t)         (constant modulus at TX)
                |[W_RF,k]_{i,j}| = 1/sqrt(N_r,k)     (constant modulus at RX)
                ||F_RF * F_BB||_F^2 = P_total          (power constraint)

  This is much harder than the single-user case because:

  1. F_RF must serve ALL users through shared hardware
  2. The digital precoder must simultaneously maximize per-user signal power AND
   suppress MUI
  3. Joint optimization across all users' precoders AND combiners is non-convex
  and coupled

  ---
  PART C: THE TWO-STAGE APPROACH

  C.1 Why Decouple?

  Direct joint optimization is intractable. The two-stage approach exploits a
  key structural insight:

  - Analog beamforming provides spatial gain by pointing beams at users — this
  depends on the angular structure of channels (slow-varying)
  - Digital precoding manages interference — this depends on the instantaneous 
  effective channel (fast-varying, but low-dimensional)

  By separating these concerns, each stage becomes tractable.

  C.2 Stage 1: Design F_RF (Analog Precoder via OMP)

  There are two sub-approaches:

  Approach 1: Per-User Independent OMP

  Pros:
  - Low feedback: each user only reports beam indices (log2(N_G) bits per beam)
  - Distributed: users can run OMP locally
  - Compatible with beam training protocols

  Cons:
  - Ignores inter-user interference in the analog stage
  - Beam conflicts when users share similar angular directions
  - No guarantee the aggregate F_RF is well-conditioned for digital precoding

  Approach 2: Joint Multi-User OMP

  Critical difference: In step (b), the selection criterion ||Psi(j,:)||_2^2
  sums the projection energy across ALL N_s columns (all users' streams), not
  just one user's streams. This means the selected beam is the one that best
  approximates the joint multi-user precoder — it naturally balances beam
  allocation across users.

  Pros:
  - Globally optimized beam allocation
  - Can handle unequal allocation (users with richer channels get more beams)
  - Better conditioning of the effective channel
  - Can implicitly avoid beam conflicts

  Cons:
  - Requires full CSI for all users at the BS
  - Higher computational complexity
  - Higher feedback overhead

  C.3 Stage 2: Design F_BB (Digital Precoder on Effective Channel)

  After F_RF is fixed, compute the effective channel for each user:

                   ┌              ┐
                   │  N_r,k x N_t │   N_t x N_RF
  H_eff,k  =  H_k │              │ * F_RF
                   └              ┘
           =  H_k * F_RF

  Size: N_r,k x N_RF

  This is the dimensionality reduction: the digital precoder now works on an
  N_RF-dimensional channel instead of N_t-dimensional. Since N_RF << N_t (e.g.,
  8 vs 64), the digital processing is much cheaper.

  The composite effective channel stacking all users:

           ┌ h_eff,1 ┐     ┌ H_1 * F_RF ┐
  H_eff =  │ h_eff,2 │  =  │ H_2 * F_RF │     (size: SUM(N_r,k) x N_RF)
           │  ...    │     │    ...      │
           └ h_eff,K ┘     └ H_K * F_RF ┘

  Now we apply standard multi-user digital precoding on H_eff:

  ---
  PART D: DIGITAL PRECODING TECHNIQUES FOR STAGE 2

  D.1 Zero-Forcing (ZF) Precoding

  Applicable when: Each user receives a single stream (N_s,k = 1), so h_eff,k is
   a 1 x N_RF row vector.

  H_eff is then a K x N_RF matrix (requires N_RF >= K).

  ZF precoder formula:

  F_BB^ZF = H_eff^H * (H_eff * H_eff^H)^(-1)

  This is the right pseudo-inverse of H_eff.

  Size check: H_eff^H is N_RF x K, (H_eff * H_eff^H) is K x K, so F_BB^ZF is
  N_RF x K.

  Why it works: After ZF precoding:

  H_eff * F_BB^ZF = H_eff * H_eff^H * (H_eff * H_eff^H)^(-1) = I_K

  The effective channel times the ZF precoder gives the identity matrix! This
  means:
  - User k's effective received signal contains ONLY its own data: h_eff,k *
  f_BB,k = 1
  - Inter-user interference is ZERO: h_eff,k * f_BB,j = 0 for j != k

  SINR under ZF:

                          rho / N_s
  SINR_k^ZF = ─────────────────────────────────
               sigma_n^2 * [(H_eff H_eff^H)^(-1)]_{k,k}

  The term [(H_eff H_eff^H)^(-1)]_{k,k} is the k-th diagonal element of the
  inverse Gram matrix. When the effective channels of different users are nearly
   aligned (poorly conditioned H_eff), this term blows up, causing noise 
  enhancement — the big weakness of ZF.

  Power normalization:

  F_BB = sqrt(P_total) * F_BB^ZF / ||F_RF * F_BB^ZF||_F

  D.2 MMSE / Regularized ZF (RZF) Precoding

  Motivation: ZF completely nulls interference but amplifies noise. At low SNR,
  this noise enhancement dominates. MMSE provides a better interference-vs-noise
   tradeoff.

  MMSE precoder formula:

  F_BB^MMSE = H_eff^H * (H_eff * H_eff^H + alpha * I_K)^(-1)

  where alpha is the regularization parameter:

  alpha = K * sigma_n^2 / P_total    =    N_s / SNR

  Behavior in limiting cases:

  High SNR (alpha --> 0):  F_BB^MMSE --> F_BB^ZF
                            (interference dominates, cancel it)

  Low SNR (alpha --> inf):  F_BB^MMSE --> (1/alpha) * H_eff^H
                            (noise dominates, use MRT for max signal power)

  At high SNR, MMSE converges to ZF because interference is the dominant
  impairment. At low SNR, MMSE converges to Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT),
  which maximizes desired signal power at the expense of allowing some
  interference.

  The MMSE precoder does not fully eliminate interference — some residual
  |h_eff,k * f_BB,j|^2 remains non-zero. But the total MSE (signal distortion +
  interference + noise) is minimized.

  Typical gains: MMSE provides 1–3 dB improvement over ZF at SNR below 5 dB. At
  SNR above 10 dB, they converge.

  D.3 Block Diagonalization (BD)

  Applicable when: Each user has multiple antennas and receives multiple streams
   (N_s,k > 1). ZF pseudo-inverse doesn't work because each user's channel is a
  matrix, not a vector.

  BD extends ZF by using null-space projections to eliminate inter-user
  interference while preserving per-user spatial multiplexing capability.

  Feasibility condition: The null space V^(0) must have dimension >= N_s,k for
  each user k. This requires:

  N_RF  >=  SUM(j!=k) rank(H_eff,j) + N_s,k    for each k

  In the simplest case (all users have same N_r, want N_s streams each):

  N_RF  >=  (K-1) * N_r + N_s

  Per-user rate after BD:

  R_k = SUM(i=1..N_s,k) log2(1 + p_k,i * sigma_tilde_k,i^2 / sigma_n^2)

  where sigma_tilde_k,i are the singular values of H_tilde_k (the
  interference-free channel), and p_k,i are per-stream power allocations
  (obtained via waterfilling).

  PART E: THE BEAM CONFLICT PROBLEM

  E.1 What Is a Beam Conflict?

  When two users have dominant channel paths at nearly the same angle of
  departure, they both "want" the same beam from the dictionary. For example:

  User 1: dominant AoD = 28 degrees  -->  selects beam at 30 degrees
  User 2: dominant AoD = 32 degrees  -->  also selects beam at 30 degrees
                                          (closest beam in dictionary)

  Now F_RF has a duplicate column (or nearly duplicate columns). The effective
  channel H_eff becomes rank-deficient:

  h_eff,1 = H_1 * F_RF  ≈  h_eff,2 = H_2 * F_RF

  When we try to apply ZF: (H_eff * H_eff^H) is nearly singular, so its inverse
  blows up. The ZF precoder amplifies noise enormously, killing performance.

  E.2 Impact on Performance

  When two users share the same beam direction:
  - The condition number of H_eff * H_eff^H increases by orders of magnitude
  - Sum rate can drop by 30–50% compared to the no-conflict case
  - ZF wastes enormous power trying to separate nearly-identical effective
  channels

  E.3 Solutions to Beam Conflicts

  Solution 1 — Conflicting-Aware (CA) Beam Selection:

  Step 1: Each user selects preferred beam index
  Step 2: Identify conflicting users (those selecting the same beam)
  Step 3: For non-conflicting users: keep their selected beams
  Step 4: For conflicting users: use SLNR (Signal-to-Leakage-plus-Noise Ratio)
          criterion to find alternative beams:

          For conflicting user k:
            b_k = argmax_b  |h_k^H a(b)|^2 / (SUM(j!=k) |h_j^H a(b)|^2 +
  sigma_n^2)
                                    ↑ signal power               ↑ leakage to
  others

  Solution 2 — User Scheduling: Don't serve conflicting users at the same time.
  Assign them to different time slots or frequency resources.

  Solution 3 — Beam Splitting: Assign one user to a slightly left-of-center beam
   and the other to a slightly right-of-center beam, creating spatial separation
   even though their true channels are close.

  PART F: OMP VARIANTS FOR MULTI-USER SYSTEMS

  F.1 Simultaneous OMP (SOMP) — Also Called MMV-OMP

  SOMP is the natural extension of OMP to the Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV)
  problem, where multiple sparse signals share the same support (sparsity
  pattern).

  How it maps to MU hybrid beamforming:
  - Each user's channel is a different "measurement vector"
  - All users share the same set of selected beams (common support = F_RF
  columns)
  - We want to find beams that jointly serve all users well

  In the hybrid beamforming context:
  - Y corresponds to the joint target precoder F_opt_joint
  - A corresponds to the steering vector dictionary A_t
  - K = N_RF (number of RF chains / beams to select)
  - L = N_s (total number of streams across all users)
  - The row-norm selection naturally picks beams that are jointly useful

  This is exactly the Joint OMP algorithm from Part C.2, Approach 2! The Joint
  OMP for hybrid beamforming IS a SOMP applied to the multi-user precoder
  approximation problem.

  F.2 Generalized OMP (GOMP)

  GOMP selects multiple beams per iteration instead of one:

  Standard OMP:  1 beam per iteration,  N_RF iterations total
  GOMP (S=2):    2 beams per iteration, N_RF/2 iterations total
  GOMP (S=K):    K beams per iteration, N_RF/K iterations (one batch per user)

  Algorithm difference — in the selection step:

  Standard OMP:  j* = argmax_j  ||Psi(j,:)||_2^2       (pick top 1)
  GOMP:          J* = indices of top S entries of {||Psi(j,:)||_2^2}  (pick top
  S)

  Advantage: Faster convergence, especially when each user needs ~S beams. One
  iteration per user rather than one iteration per beam.

  Disadvantage: Less fine-grained selection — picking S beams at once may not be
   as optimal as picking them one-by-one with residual updates.

  F.3 Group-Sparsity OMP

  In mmWave channels, rays within the same scattering cluster have similar 
  angles. This creates natural groups of adjacent beams in the dictionary.

  Group OMP selects entire angular groups at once:

  Instead of:  "pick the single best beam"
  It does:     "pick the best angular cluster of beams"

  Selection: p* = argmax_p  ||A_{G_p}^H * F_res||_F^2
             (maximize projection energy of the ENTIRE group G_p)

  This is more efficient when the channel has concentrated angular power
  profiles — selecting all beams in a cluster simultaneously rather than
  one-by-one.

  PART G: NUMERICAL EXAMPLE — MU OMP HYBRID BEAMFORMING

  Setup

  Parameters:
    N_t  = 16  (BS transmit antennas, ULA)
    N_RF = 4   (RF chains at BS)
    K    = 2   (users)
    N_r  = 1   (single antenna per user, for simplicity)
    N_s  = 2   (one stream per user, total 2 streams)
    N_G  = 32  (dictionary size, oversampling factor 2)
    d    = lambda/2  (half-wavelength spacing)

  Step 1: Channel Generation

  Each user's channel follows Saleh-Valenzuela model with 2 clusters, 3 rays
  each:

  User 1: Dominant AoDs at ~25 degrees and ~-50 degrees
  User 2: Dominant AoDs at ~70 degrees and ~-10 degrees

  Both users' channels: h_1 in C^(1 x 16), h_2 in C^(1 x 16)

  Step 2: Build Dictionary

  32 steering vectors for 16-element ULA:

  a_t(phi_q) = (1/sqrt(16)) * [1, e^(j*pi*sin(phi_q)), ...,
  e^(j*15*pi*sin(phi_q))]^T

  phi_q = -90 + (q-1) * 180/32  for q = 1,...,32
        = -90, -84.4, -78.8, ..., 0, ..., +84.4 degrees

  Step 3: Per-User OMP (Approach 1)

  User 1 gets 2 beams (N_RF/K = 4/2 = 2):

  Iteration 1:
    Compute Psi_1 = A_t^H * h_1^H           (32 x 1 vector)
    Find j* = argmax |Psi_1(j)|^2
    --> Selects beam at ~25 degrees (near User 1's dominant AoD)
    F_RF,1 = [a_t(25 deg)]                   (16 x 1)

  Iteration 2:
    Update residual
    --> Selects beam at ~-50 degrees (User 1's second cluster)
    F_RF,1 = [a_t(25 deg) | a_t(-50 deg)]    (16 x 2)

  User 2 gets 2 beams:

  Iteration 1: --> Selects beam at ~70 degrees
  Iteration 2: --> Selects beam at ~-10 degrees
  F_RF,2 = [a_t(70 deg) | a_t(-10 deg)]      (16 x 2)

  Aggregate:

  F_RF = [a_t(25 deg) | a_t(-50 deg) | a_t(70 deg) | a_t(-10 deg)]
         (16 x 4 matrix — 4 selected beams from dictionary)

  Step 4: Compute Effective Channel

  h_eff,1 = h_1 * F_RF     (1 x 4 row vector)
  h_eff,2 = h_2 * F_RF     (1 x 4 row vector)

  H_eff = [h_eff,1]        (2 x 4 matrix)
          [h_eff,2]

  Each entry h_eff,k(j) represents how much of user k's channel energy passes
  through beam j.

  Example values (illustrative):

           beam 1    beam 2    beam 3    beam 4
           (25 deg) (-50 deg) (70 deg) (-10 deg)
  User 1: [ 0.85     0.42     0.05      0.12  ]    (strong on beams 1,2)
  User 2: [ 0.08     0.03     0.78      0.55  ]    (strong on beams 3,4)

  Good news: the users are well-separated angularly, so H_eff is
  well-conditioned!

  Step 5: ZF Digital Precoding on Effective Channel

  F_BB^ZF = H_eff^H * (H_eff * H_eff^H)^(-1)     (4 x 2 matrix)

  After this:

  H_eff * F_BB^ZF = [1  0]    (identity — interference cancelled!)
                    [0  1]

  Normalize: F_BB = sqrt(2) * F_BB^ZF / ||F_RF * F_BB^ZF||_F

  Step 6: Compute Sum Rate

  SINR_1 = (rho/2) * |h_eff,1 * f_BB,1|^2 / sigma_n^2
  SINR_2 = (rho/2) * |h_eff,2 * f_BB,2|^2 / sigma_n^2

  R_sum = log2(1 + SINR_1) + log2(1 + SINR_2)

  What if we used Joint OMP instead?

  With Joint OMP, the target is:

  F_opt_joint = [v_1(H_1) | v_1(H_2)]    (16 x 2, concatenated first right
  SVectors)

  The joint OMP selection criterion considers BOTH columns simultaneously:

  j* = argmax_j  |a_t(phi_j)^H f_opt,1|^2 + |a_t(phi_j)^H f_opt,2|^2
                       ↑ correlation with user 1    ↑ correlation with user 2

  This produces a beam set that globally balances the two users' needs. If the
  two users are well-separated, the joint approach produces similar results to
  per-user OMP. But when users overlap angularly, the joint approach can select
  beams that are more discriminating between them.

  H.3 Key Theoretical Result — Rate Loss Bound

  When analog beams use B_1 bits and digital effective channel uses B_2 bits:

  Rate loss <= log2(1 + (P/sigma_n^2) * K * (2^(-B_1/(N_t-1)) +
  2^(-B_2/(N_RF-1))))

  Key insight: The digital feedback B_2 scales with N_RF (small, e.g., 4–8), NOT
   with N_t (large, e.g., 64–256). This makes the feedback overhead dramatically
   smaller than fully digital limited-feedback systems.

  For example, with N_t = 64, N_RF = 4:
  - Fully digital: feedback for 64-dimensional channel (huge)
  - Hybrid: feedback for 4-dimensional effective channel (small!)

  H.4 The Receiver Side

  Each user k designs its analog combiner independently:

  w_RF,k = argmax_{w in W}  |w^H * H_k * f_RF,k|

  where W is the receive beam codebook and f_RF,k is the BS beam assigned to
  user k

  Since each user has a single RF chain, the combiner is just a single steering
  vector — the one that maximizes the received power along the assigned BS beam
  direction.

  I.2 Key Observations

  Observation 1: The N_RF >= 2K rule. When the number of RF chains is at least
  twice the number of users, hybrid OMP achieves within 1–2 dB of fully digital.
   This is because with 2x oversampling, the analog precoder has enough degrees
  of freedom to both capture channel energy AND provide the digital precoder
  with a well-conditioned effective channel.

  Observation 2: The digital stage recovers 5–15 dB. Comparing hybrid (analog +
  digital) to analog-only, the digital ZF/MMSE stage provides a massive
  improvement by eliminating inter-user interference. Analog-only cannot manage
  MUI at all.

  Observation 3: Joint OMP vs Per-User OMP. Joint OMP typically provides 2–4 dB
  better sum rate than per-user OMP, especially when:
  - Users have overlapping angular spreads (beam conflicts)
  - N_RF is tightly limited relative to K
  - Channel conditions are imbalanced across users

  Observation 4: MMSE vs ZF. At low SNR (below 5 dB), MMSE provides ~1.5 bps/Hz
  improvement over ZF. At high SNR (above 10 dB), they converge to within 0.5
  bps/Hz.

  operates in the time/RF domain, before the IFFT). But each subcarrier has a
  different channel:

  Channel at subcarrier m for user k:  H_k[m]

  Analog precoder: F_RF (same for all m)
  Digital precoder: F_BB[m] (can vary per subcarrier)

  The approach:

  Stage 1: Design F_RF using AVERAGE across subcarriers
           F_opt_avg = (1/M) * SUM(m=1..M) F_opt[m]
           Run OMP on F_opt_avg to get F_RF

  Stage 2: For each subcarrier m separately:
           H_eff[m] = [H_1[m]; ...; H_K[m]] * F_RF
           F_BB[m] = ZF or MMSE on H_eff[m]

  An important wideband issue is beam squint: a beam steered to angle phi at the
   center frequency points to a slightly different angle at edge frequencies.
  This can cause 1–3 dB loss for wideband systems with large arrays.

  J.2 User Scheduling

  With hybrid beamforming, user scheduling becomes critical because N_RF limits
  the number of simultaneously servable users. The Semi-Orthogonal User 
  Selection (SUS) algorithm selects users whose effective channels are
  approximately orthogonal:

  1. Compute effective channels h_eff,k for all candidate users
  2. Select first user: k1 = argmax_k ||h_eff,k||^2 (strongest user)
  3. For each subsequent slot:
     - Project remaining users' channels onto orthogonal complement of selected
  users
     - Remove users whose projected component is too small (nearly parallel)
     - Select the user with largest projected component
  4. Repeat until N_RF users selected or pool exhausted

  J.3 CSI Acquisition

  Acquiring channel state information is the practical bottleneck. The
  two-timescale approach helps:

  - Slow timescale (every ~100 ms): Estimate channel covariance R_k for analog
  precoder design
  - Fast timescale (every ~1 ms): Estimate effective channel h_eff,k = h_k *
  F_RF for digital precoder. This is only N_RF-dimensional, so pilot overhead
  scales with N_RF (small), not N_t (large)
